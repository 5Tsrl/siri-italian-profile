# XML examples of SIRI Italian Profile

[The Examples directory](https://github.com/5Tsrl/netex-italian-profile/tree/main/siri-italian-profile/Examples) contains all available XML examples of SIRI for the Italian Profile.

# XSD

The real-time data are not customized with an Italian Profile XSD, so the standard version is used: the xsd folder is available in [the original repository](https://github.com/SIRI-CEN/SIRI/tree/master/xsd).
